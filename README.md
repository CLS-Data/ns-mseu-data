# Next Steps Longitudinal Dataset 

[Centre for Longitudinal Studies](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/)

---

## Overview
- This repository provides **R scripts** that harmonise the multiple sweeps of [**Next Steps**](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/next-steps/) into a single tidy dataset, so analysts can get straight to research rather than recoding. 
- The variables are given consistent names which relate to the content and age of participants (e.g., `Educ25` for education attainment at age 25).
